This website is forked from [<font color="brown">rasilab</font>](https://www.rasilab.org), which in turn is derived from [<font color="brown">bedford.io</font>](https://www.bedford.io). The source code for the original website can be found [<font color="brown">here</font>](https://github.com/blab/blotter/). When designing my website, I initially explored another static site generator, [<font color="brown">Hugo</font>](http://gohugo.io), in particular the tailor-designed [<font color="brown">Hugo-Academic-Theme</font>](https://themes.gohugo.io/academic/). While I eventually chose to go with Jekyll, I did, however, borrow some elements from that theme, such as the Profile on the homepage.
