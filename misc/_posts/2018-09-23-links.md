## Protocols

Due to historical reasons, our protocols are a bit scattered in several places. Hope to consolidate them at some point. But for now here they are:
- [Lab protocol site](https://protocols.binhe-lab.org/)
- Bin's protocols on [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0BzL_Etr6O7DMZDI4YmQ3MzQtZWNjMS00NDMwLWI0ZmItYjA0ZDQ4ZDg5NGVk)
- [Lab protocol on Benchling](https://benchling.com/s/seq-xc0c4oBbFwrj4KnbhT6e)

We also borrow heavily from the following resources:
- A very helpful site from [Megan McClean lab](https://openwetware.org/wiki/McClean:Protocols) at UW Madison
- [Another](http://cshprotocols.cshlp.org/) good source for protocols from the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory

## Research resources
- [Lab GitHub](https://github.com/binhe-lab) (analysis, teaching and this website)
- [Bin's RPubs](https://rpubs.com/emptyhb) (published analyses authored in Rmarkdown)
- [Bin's talks in HTML](https://talks.binhe-lab.org/) (other talks on my personal blog [link](https://binhe.org/talks))
- Interactive Data Plotter via shinyapps
    - [link](https://binhe-lab.shinyapps.io/gene-plot-Pi-starvation-time-course/) Phosphate starvation time course in _C. glabrata_
