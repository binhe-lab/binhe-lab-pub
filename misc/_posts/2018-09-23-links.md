## Protocols

Due to historical reasons, our protocols are a bit scattered in several places. Hope to consolidate them at some point. But for now here they are:
- [Lab protocol site](https://protocols.binhe-lab.org/)
- Bin's protocols on [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0BzL_Etr6O7DMZDI4YmQ3MzQtZWNjMS00NDMwLWI0ZmItYjA0ZDQ4ZDg5NGVk)
- [Lab protocol on Benchling](https://benchling.com/s/seq-xc0c4oBbFwrj4KnbhT6e)

We also borrow heavily from the following resources:
- A very helpful site from [Megan McClean lab](https://openwetware.org/wiki/McClean:Protocols) at UW Madison
- [Another](http://cshprotocols.cshlp.org/) good source for protocols from the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory

## Research resources
- [Lab GitHub](https://github.com/binhe-lab)
- [Bin's RPubs](https://rpubs.com/emptyhb)

## Misc
- [Lab expectations](/misc/expect)
- [Group meeting slides](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1_Gkz3hpu4GpSNdg-g1hkfIrDxlCJELRT?usp=sharing)
- [Lab registries (strains, chemicals, etc.)](https://drive.google.com/open?id=12FozsGKhPgBTYOWpzn-SKNIwIGBP-42x). Note that chemicals and other inventory items can be found on our [Quartzy](https://app.quartzy.com/groups/199028/) site.
