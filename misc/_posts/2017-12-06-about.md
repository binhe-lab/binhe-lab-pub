This website is based on [<font color="brown">rasilab</font>](https://www.rasilab.org) and [<font color="brown">bedford.io</font>](https://www.bedford.io). It is powered by the static site generator [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com). The source code for this site can be found [<font color="brown">here</font>](https://github.com/binhe-lab/binhe-lab-pub), and source code for the original [bedford.io](http://bedford.io) website [<font color="brown">here</font>](https://github.com/blab/blotter/). Some of the design elements were borrowed from [<font color="brown">Hugo-Academic-Theme</font>](https://themes.gohugo.io/academic/). You are welcome to copy and modify this site for your own use.

For deployment, I hosted the code for the website on GitHub as shown above, and deployed it through [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com) with a custom domain assigned.
