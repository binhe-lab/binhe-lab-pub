As a junior PI, I plan to grow my lab slowly and expect to work closely **[with](http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004387)** members of the lab. I'm looking for both graduate students (MS and PhD) and research technicians who are curious, responsible and motivated. Here is [more](/join/expect) on what I expect of you and what you can expect from me. 

Prior experience with microbiology genetics, R programming and genomics experiments are desirable but not required. As long as you are interested in what we are doing, and serious about doing reproducible science, you are in!

## Graduate students

I'm affiliated with the iBio graduate program in the Biology Department at the University of Iowa. Please check the [website](https://biology.uiowa.edu/ibio) for details on requirements and application deadlines. Contacts about research interests are welcome.

## Research technician

Both current undergraduate students seeking to work/study or for research credits, and recently graduated college/master students looking for more research experiences, are encouraged to directly contact me via email (bin-he # uiowa.edu). Please send a 1-page statement of research interests, CV and contact information for three references.
