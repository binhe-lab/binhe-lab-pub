### Abstract ###

Animals typically respond to their reflection as a conspecific and will respond as if the reflection were another animal that they could interact with, either fearfully or aggressively. We investigated how a modified reflective environment of a standard glass aquarium affects the aggressive and fearful behaviors of the crayfish _Orconectes virilis_, based on pre-determined behavior criteria. We found that the crayfish were both increasingly aggressive and slightly fearful in the reflective environment compared to minimal behavioral changes in the control non-reflective environment. Thus, our findings support that crayfish recognize their mirror image as a conspecific.
