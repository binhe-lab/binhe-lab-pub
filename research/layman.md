Think of the gene regulatory network controlling various stress responses as the **blueprint** of the different emergency departments in a city. While the basic units are likely similar or identical, e.g. fire, police and ambulance, each city, due to its _unique history_ and _particular natural and demographic conditions_, will likely have different ways to organize these units, hence a different blueprint. We hypothesize that the same is true for stress response networks. Specifically, as previous research has shown that the transcriptional factors regulating stress responses are often highly conserved in evolution, while _how they are regulated_ and _what responses they elicit_ can evolve rapidly, we set out to answer the following questions:

    <p>Think of the gene regulatory network (GRN) controlling stress responses as the <strong>blueprint</strong> for different emergency responses in a city. Our question, then, is "how do different cities organize their emergency responses differently based on their unique natural and demographic conditions? </p>
