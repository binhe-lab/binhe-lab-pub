I am a senior in high school at City High, Iowa City. I have been an intern and a member of Dr. He’s lab since May 2020. Since I began my internship, I have worked with Dr. He and Amanda Caraballo on two research projects, the second of which is still ongoing. Previously, I analyzed the gene expression patterns of _S. cerevisiae_ and _C. glabrata_ during different phosphate starvation environments. My current project is investigating the phylogeny of the SOD proteins of _C. albicans_. I have used RStudio and other data analysis programs for my projects. I look forward to learning more through Dr. He and his lab about what it means to be a scientific researcher. I appreciate Dr. He’s patience with me and my naivety as I learn laboratory and computer analysis techniques. I am hoping someday to train in behavioral psychology and study animal behavior. I am a passionate pianist, teach ice skating, and am an amateur but avid wildlife photographer.
