I am a 2024 Graduate of the University of Iowa with a BA in Biology. Within the lab, my main focuses have been on 1.)Understanding the phosphate pathway bistability that occurs in S. cerevisiae, and contrasting it with other species like C. glabrata. 2.) Tracing the possible evolution of the Efg1 transcription factor in budding yeast species, to get a better understanding of the individual species history and pathogenetic potential.

Outside of the lab, I can be found working at the University of Iowa Food Pantry, studying for classes, or watching as many movies as I can down at Filmscene
