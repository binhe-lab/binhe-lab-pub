I am an undergraduate engineering student at the University of Minnesota Twin Cities. I grew up in Iowa City and have lived here most of my life. My grandfather, an emeritus professor in the biology department, pointed me towards the bio department for possible summer work.  I had previously spent my summers volunteering at the University of Iowa Museum of Natural History in the collections department. I was introduced to this lab over spring break and joined on at the beginning of the 2018 summer.

I am super excited and lucky to join Bin Heâ€™s lab on May 31st. Bin He is a very outstanding, kind and patient mentor, and he helps me a lot to learn how to do biology research. My summer project is to validate transcription factor CgPho4 targets, which is also my first project.
