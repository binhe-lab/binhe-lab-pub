I am an undergraduate from the University of New Mexico studying Biology with minors in Chemistry and Interdisciplinary Liberal Arts. I am part of the Interdisciplinary Evolutionary Biology REU. I am fascinated by genetics and am excited to learn more about the research process from start to finish. This summer I am working on an experimental evolution project investigating the evolution of transcriptional cofactor independence.

Outside of the lab, I enjoy baking, watercolor, and hiking.
