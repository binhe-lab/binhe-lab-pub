I am an undergraduate student at the University of Iowa studying Biochemistry and Molecular Biology with a minor in Computer Science. Originally from Palmdale, California, I grew up largely in West Des Moines, Iowa. Outside of research, I enjoy reading, going outside, and watching MMA. 

I joined Dr. He’s lab in September of 2024. Since then, I have greatly enjoyed the opportunity to engage with high-level scientific research and develop a deeper understanding of molecular biology through studying the phosphate starvation regulatory pathways in the yeast species Candida glabrata. Through this opportunity, I hope to contribute meaningfully to the lab’s research, sharpen my skills in experimental techniques, and develop as a scientist.
