I am a sophomore at the University of Iowa, double-majoring in Biology (B.S.) and Dance (B.A.).

I joined Dr. He’s lab in February of 2025\. In this collaborative and welcoming environment, I have learned a lot from peers and gained experience through analyzing research papers, shadowing lab members, and learning foundational lab skills. I am curious about how the environment of microbes affects their ability to survive and adapt.

My hometown is Zionsville, Indiana. In my free time, I enjoy traveling, photography, hiking, and assisting with classes at the University of Iowa Youth Ballet and Community Dance School.
