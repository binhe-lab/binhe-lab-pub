I am an Associate Professor in the [Biology Department](https://biology.uiowa.edu) at the University of Iowa. I grew up in the city of Shanghai, China. After graduating from high school, I ventured to the capital Beijing for college. I graduated in 2006 with a bachelor's degree in biological sciences from [Peking University](https://www.pku.edu.cn). After college, I applied and got accepted into gradute program in the Ecology and Evolution Department at [The University of Chicago](http://pondside.uchicago.edu/ecol-evol/), where I worked with [Martin Kreitman](http://pondside.uchicago.edu/ecol-evol/people/kreitman.html) on population genetics of gene regulatory sequences in _Drosophila_. 

Having done both [genotype-fitness](/papers/selected-papers/He-PLoS-Genet/) and [genotype-phenotype](/papers/selected-papers/He-Genetics-2014/) mapping, I feel unsatisfied as in both cases the underlying biology remains unknown. To gain a functional understanding of the effects of regulatory variation, I joined the lab of [Erin O'Shea](http://www.hhmi.org/scientists/erin-k-oshea) at the [Center for Systems Biology](http://sysbio.harvard.edu/home) in Harvard University, where I studied the [evolution of stress response regulation](/papers/selected-papers/he-elife-2017/) in a commensal yeast. 

Outside of science, I enjoy baking, jogging and swimming.
