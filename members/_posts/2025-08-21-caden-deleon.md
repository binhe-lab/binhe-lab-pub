My name is Caden DeLeon. I am from Iowa City, Iowa, but grew up mostly in Lakeland, Florida. I am a senior majoring Biomedical Engineering with minors in biology and chemistry. I have been a member of Dr. He’s lab since January of 2025.

Since joining the lab, I am working under the guidance of graduate lab member Emily O’Brien. I have been gaining knowledge in general undergraduate research and will focus on plasmid construction in relation the PHO regulation pathway in yeast. I have spent time with the undergraduate journal club breaking down research papers to expand my understanding of these pathways and help with the transition into an active research role.
