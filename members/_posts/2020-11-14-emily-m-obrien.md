My name is Emily O'Brien. I am from Sumner, Iowa and am a senior studying biology at the University of Iowa. I have been a member of Dr. He's lab since August of 2020. Outside of school I am also involved with the Personal Genome Learning Center and Salt Company.

During my time at the lab, I have been gaining experience in general research techniques as well as chimera construction and research related to the Pho4 transcription factor and the phosphate starvation pathway in yeast. I am excited to continue growing in my knowledge of research.

_Emily has transitioned to become a research assistant after she graduated from the university in 2021 May._
