I’m Angelique (Angel) Akimana, I’m a biology major with a chemistry minor on the pre-med track. I’m originally from Burundi, but I grew up in Cedar Rapids, Iowa. I joined the GRE lab in October 2025, and honestly, it was one of the best decisions I’ve made during my undergraduate years. I’ve always been fascinated by how genes evolve over time and how those changes drive diversity and adaptation in organisms. Through this opportunity, I hope to contribute meaningfully to the lab’s research, sharpen my skills in experimental techniques, and continue developing as a scientist.

Outside of research, I enjoy reading, gardening, and watching movies.
