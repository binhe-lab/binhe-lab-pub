I am an undergraduate student at the University of Iowa studying Biology. I come to Iowa from Fort Wayne, Indiana and have been a member of Dr. Heâ€™s lab since my sophomore year. Since joining the lab, I have spent time learning different research techniques and I am currently working on developing a research project of my own to investigate the evolution of stress responses in related yeast species. Outside of lab, my interests include watching sports, reading, and walking outside.
