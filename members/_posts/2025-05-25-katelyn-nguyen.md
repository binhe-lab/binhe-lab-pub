I am an undergraduate student at the University of California, San Diego, studying Computer Science and Bioinformatics. My research at UCSD has focused on microglia's role in spinal cord injury, bloom filters in host filtering, and compact phylogenetic tree representation. I am very excited to be an REU student in the GRE lab for the summer of 2025! I will be working on a project analyzing the evolutionary history of the adhesinome in yeast pathogens.

Outside of academics, I enjoy reading, table tennis, juggling, identifying plants, and watching musicals.
