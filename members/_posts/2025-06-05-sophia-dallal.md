My name is Sophia Dallal, and I am a junior undergraduate at the University of Iowa studying biomedical engineering. I am from Dubuque, Iowa, and love to run, ski, bike, journal, and listen to music in my free time. 

In the GRE Lab, I study the evolution of transcription factor networks in yeast. My project focuses on how Saccharomyces cerevisiae requires the cofactor Pho2 alongside Pho4 to activate stress response genes, while the related species Candida glabrata has a stronger response without Pho2. This comparative approach helps uncover how gene regulatory networks evolve and adapt across species.
