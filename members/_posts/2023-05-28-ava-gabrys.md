I am an undergraduate student at Penn State studying Biology with a focus in genetics and developmental biology. This summer I am a part of the Interdisciplinary Evolutionary Sciences REU, working in Dr. Heâ€™s lab on a project characterizing and exploring the evolution of fungal adhesins. Outside of the lab I enjoy baking, reading, and hiking.
