I am an undergraduate student in my senior year at Coe College studying general biology. I joined the lab during the summer of 2021 as a summer REU student and stayed on during the school year.

Currently, I am investigating variation in oxidative stress resistance and virulence of different strains of C. glabrata. I'm using G. mellonella as an infection model for virulence. I am also interested in the genetic basis of variations in oxidative stress resistance in natural isolates.

In my free time, I enjoy bothering Jinye (and also Lindsey sometimes). Also, I'm bad at acknowledging people.
