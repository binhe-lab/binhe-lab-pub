**Update 2025-08-25** Jess has joined the Integrated Biology Graduate Program and is an incoming MS student in our lab. Welcome back in your new role, Jess!

I am an undergraduate student at the University of Iowa studying Chemistry, with a Minor in Biology on the pre-pharmacy track. I am originally from Justice, Illinois and I  joined Dr. He's lab in January 2022. Since I have been at the lab, my focus is digesting research papers to aid in the development of my own research project regarding yeast phosphotase pathways. I have also spent time understanding and developing skills with the mechanistic approaches we use in this lab.

Outside of research, I am a member in the Hawkeye Drumline, an Executive Orientation Leader and a teaching assistant for Explore Iowa. My interests include gardening, Hawkeye sports and camping!
