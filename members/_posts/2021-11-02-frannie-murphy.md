I am an undergraduate student at the University of Iowa studying bioinformatics. My focus is on gaining familiarity with existing scientific literature in the area of stress responses in microorganisms, especially research concerning differing stress responses in pathogenic species when compared to nonpathogenic species and pH stress responses. My other interests include reading and growing houseplants.
