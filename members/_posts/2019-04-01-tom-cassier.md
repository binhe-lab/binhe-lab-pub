I am a 2017 graduate of the University of Iowa holding Bachelor of Science degrees in Neurobiology and Psychology.

I currently work with the transcription factor Pho4 in _Candida glabrata_ (cg) and _Saccharomyces cerevisiae_ (sc). My primary focus is to isolate the Pho4 protein from these two species and conduct functionality experiments with the isolated protein. While CgPho4 and ScPho4 serve the same function in the phosphate stress response, their requirements for full functionality are quite distinct. ScPho4 requires another transcription factor, Pho2, in order to upregulate the majority of genes under its control, while CgPho4 acts primarily independently. Our goal is to elucidate the causes and mechanisms for the differences we see in Pho2 dependence between these two species. This will give the scientific community a deeper understanding of the ever common basic-helix-loop-helix protein family and transcription factors as a whole.

Outside of science, most of my passions are outdoors. I spend my time road biking, hiking, rock climbing and fishing. I also enjoy weightlifting, playing video games,and reading (especially during the long Iowa winters!). I will be attending the Carver College of Medicine starting fall of 2019.
