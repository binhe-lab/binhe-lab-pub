I am an undergraduate student in the Biology Program at The University of Texas Permian Basin. I am currently training at the University of Iowa through the Interdisciplinary Evolutionary Biology REU Program in Dr. He's Lab and will be doing a poster/project on a yeast adhesin this summer.

When I'm not in the lab, I enjoy watching horror movies, hanging out with friends, and reading!
