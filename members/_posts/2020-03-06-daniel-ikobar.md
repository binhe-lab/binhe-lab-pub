I am a third year student majoring in Biochemistry with minors in Chemistry and Informatics.

My hobbies include playing sports, listening to music, and watching documentaries on Netflix.

I am looking forward to conducting research under Dr. He, and I believe that I will end up learning a lot from him and everyone else in the lab.
