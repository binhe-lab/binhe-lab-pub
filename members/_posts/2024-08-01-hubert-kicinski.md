I am a iBio Master's student studying gene regulatory evolution using genetic, biochemical, and computational techniques. My current project focuses on investigating acquired stress resistance response in evolutionary related yeast species. To assist in quantifying the ASR response, I am also working to develop a flow cytometry based method for accurately assessing post-oxidative stress survival in yeasts. Using this flow cytometry based technique, I hope to further characterized ASR in diverse yeast species and better understand the evolutionary trajectory of the ASR trait. My personal interests outside of research involves reading, weight lifting, and scrapbooking.
