I am a graduate student at University of Iowa studying statistics. I come from Beijing, China, graduated from Nankai University, China, with BS in statistics and Biology. I joined Dr. Heâ€™s lab in November 2023. I am interested in bioinformation and especially on algorithms and how they apply to biological or evolutional problems. Right now, I am working on the application of co-clustering methods on transcriptome data with prior orthogroup information. In my free time I like to watch sports, work out, and bike.
