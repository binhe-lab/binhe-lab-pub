My name is Shriya Magatapalli, and I am currently a freshman majoring in Neuroscience at the University of Iowa. In my free time, I enjoy reading, watching mystery shows, and cooking!

I joined Dr. Heâ€™s lab in August of 2021. I look forward to learning more about the lab, the scientific procedures, and how stress responses evolve!
