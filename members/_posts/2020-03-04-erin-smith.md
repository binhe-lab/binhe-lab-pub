My name is Erin Smith, I am from Cedar Rapids, Iowa, and I am a sophomore studying Biomedical Sciences at the University of Iowa with the goal of attending Medical School in the future. I have been a member of Dr. He's lab since October of 2019. Outside of school and research, I am a member of Chi Omega Sorority and Women in Science and Engineering. In my free time, I enjoy fitness, music, and trying new foods.

Within the lab, I have been working closely with my mentor, Dr. He, and my fellow lab members to master techniques essential to the function and success of our research, such as experimental design, bacterial and yeast transformations, phosphatase assays, Pho4 transcription factor chimera constructs, molecular cloning, and statistical analysis. I look forward to experiencing more opportunities within the lab that allow me to broaden my understanding of evolutionary microbiology.
