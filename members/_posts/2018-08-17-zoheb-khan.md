I am an undergraduate student at the University of Iowa studying Biomedical Engineering, with a focus area of bioinformatics.

My current project involves reproducing figures from Roetzer et al. (2010) "Regulation of Candida glabrata oxidative stress resistance is adapted to host environment" using R.

I also enjoy lifting, traveling, and graphic design.
