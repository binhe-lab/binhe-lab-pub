I am a research assistant in Dr. Heâ€™s lab. I got my bachelors in Biology- molecular/genetics at University of Wisconsin. I did undergrad research on convergence of paddleform traits in testudines and pleiosaur. Along with research in characterizing novel genetic role in plant-symbiotic signaling. I am currently working on identifying TFs that have diverged between yeast species to characterize the temporal dynamic differences in their stress response. Some of my hobbies includes reading, pottery, biking and hiking.
