I am a freshman biology major and I am also working towards a chemistry minor. I am from a town in central Iowa called Marshalltown, but I graduated highschool from East Marshall High School in LeGrand Iowa. My favorite past times are swimming, reading, and learning new things.

I was incredibly happy to join Professor Bin's lab in December of 2019. I am very new to the procedures and techniques, but Professor Bin is a patient and persistent teacher. I am grateful that my first lab experince is with a Professor that wants to help me develop my skills! My first project is investigating the possible cofactors of a phosphate regulatory protein in the yeast species called Candida Glabrata.
