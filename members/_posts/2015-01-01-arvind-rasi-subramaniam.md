I am an Assistant Member at the [Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center](http://www.fhcrc.org/) affiliated with the [Basic Sciences Division](http://www.fredhutch.org/en/labs/basic-sciences/faculty-labs.html) and with the [Computational Biology Program](http://labs.fhcrc.org/compbio/). I am also an Affiliate Assistant Professor in the [Department of Genome Sciences](http://www.gs.washington.edu/faculty/) at the University of Washington.

I am originally from [Erode](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erode), a small town in Southern India. I received my bachelor's degree in Metallurgical and Materials Engineering from the [Indian Institute of Technology Madras](https://mme.iitm.ac.in/). I then switched to theoretical physics for my PhD, which I got at the [University of Chicago](http://physics.uchicago.edu/) working with [Ilya Gruzberg](https://physics.osu.edu/people/gruzberg.1) on disorder-induced quantum phase transitions. At the end of my graduate school, I caught the systems biology bug, and decided to try my hand at wet-lab experiments. This led to a postdoc at the [Center for Systems Biology](http://sysbio.harvard.edu/home) in Harvard University, where I worked with [Philippe Cluzel](https://www.mcb.harvard.edu/mcb/faculty/profile/philippe-cluzel/) and [Erin O'Shea](http://www.hhmi.org/scientists/erin-k-oshea) on regulation of protein synthesis. Outside of science, I enjoy cooking, swing dancing, and biking.
