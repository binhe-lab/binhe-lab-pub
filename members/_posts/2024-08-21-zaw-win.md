I am a biology major on the pre-medical track. I was born in Yangon, Myanmar (also known as Burma) but grew up in the United States, specifically in the Quad Cities, Illinois (Rock Island!).

Joining GRE was one of my best decisions in my undergraduate years. The thought of being in a lab was a little intimidating at first. However, GRE has been a great place for learning basic and complex laboratory skills, as well as how to think outside of the box. I have not only gained a lot of knowledge through observation but have also developed those skills through hands-on experiences.

Outside of lab, I am a volunteer on the Burn Trauma Unit at the University of Iowa Hospitals & Clinics, where I am also a mentor who trains incoming volunteers. In addition, I am a peer mentor for underclassmen through the Biology Undergraduate Mentorship Program (BUMP). Aside from school and extracurriculars, I love staying indoors with a good book, thrifting, and photography!
