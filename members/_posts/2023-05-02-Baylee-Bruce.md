I am a graduate student in the Interdisciplinary Program in Genetics here at the University of Iowa. I graduated from St. Ambrose University with a BS in Biology in Spring of 2022. I am interested in protein-protein interactions and how those interactions have evolved at the molecular level. Currently I am investigating nucleosome-transcription factor interactions and how transcription factors gain nucleosome depleting ability. I am originally from the small town of Vinton, IA and in my free time I like to read, swim, and cook!
