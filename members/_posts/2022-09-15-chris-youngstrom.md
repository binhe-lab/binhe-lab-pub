I am a post-doctoral scholar in the gene regulatory evolution laboratory of Dr. Bin He. Currently I am exploring the evolution of stress responses in related species of yeast. Prior to joining the lab, my graduate work focused on the evolution of stem-cell regulation by WUSCHEL-RELATED HOMEOBOX (WOX) transcription factors in lycophytes, ferns, and flowering plants. My graduate work spurred my interest in how gene regulation evolved in both stress and developmental regulatory pathways. Outside of the lab my interests include astrophotography, golfing, cooking, 3d printing, watch collecting and repair.
