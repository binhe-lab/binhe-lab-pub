I am a rising sophomore who major in biology, and I have a chemistry minor and a psychology minor. I am from a small town in Hunan Province in China, and I finished my pre-college education in Hunan province. Since November 23rd, I have been in the US for higher education.

I enjoy watching Youtube, traveling, reading novels and trying new things. 

I am super excited and lucky to join Bin Heâ€™s lab on May 31st. Bin He is a very outstanding, kind and patient mentor, and he helps me a lot to learn how to do biology research. My summer project is to validate transcription factor CgPho4 targets, which is also my first project.
