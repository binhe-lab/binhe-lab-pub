I am a post-doctoral researcher who joined Dr. Bin He's lab in March of 2023. My PhD work primarily consisted of identifying genes related to antibotic stress sensing and resistance in the opportunistic bacterial pathogen Clostridioides difficile. We were particulally interested in what regulatory factors were responsible for sensing antimicrobial stressors and how these regulators mediated resistance. Outside of the lab I can often be found playing guitar or unnecissarily complicated board games.
