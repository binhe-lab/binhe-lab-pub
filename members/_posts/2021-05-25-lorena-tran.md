I am an undergraduate studying Biology and Arabic.  I grew up in San Francisco but moved to Iowa City in high school.  In my free time, I enjoy biking, swimming, birdwatching and watching basketball.

I joined Dr. Heâ€™s lab as a freshman in March of 2021.  I am excited to learn more about molecular cloning protocols and gene regulation, as well as data analysis and experimental design.
