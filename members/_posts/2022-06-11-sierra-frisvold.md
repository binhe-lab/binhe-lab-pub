I am a summer intern for this lab through the Kirkwood Workplace Learning Connection program. I am a senior at West High School with an interest in studying biology. Outside of biology, I love hiking, traveling and reading.

I joined Dr. He's lab in June of 2022 and can not wait to see more of what they do here. I hope to learn more about the aspects of a biology lab and get my own hands on experience with some ideas that interest me.
