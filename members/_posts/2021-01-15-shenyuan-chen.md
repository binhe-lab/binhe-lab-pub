My name is Shenyuan Chen, and Iâ€™m currently a senior from Regina High School in Iowa City. I applied to this internship in January 2021 and am honored to be a part of this lab since then. Due to the implications of the pandemic, I participated in the lab through remote means. Ever since I joined the lab, I work closely with Professor Bin to use python to create a program that can count and store the frequency of protein sequences of different k-mer in a protein string. Thanks to the help of Professor Bin and other labmates, I gained more insight regarding gene regulation and learned the importance of independence and communication skills in a lab setting.
