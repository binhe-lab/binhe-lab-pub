I am an undergraduate student at the University of Iowa studying Biology and German with a minor in History. I am on the biotechnology and genetics track and I am especially interested in how genetics can be used to provide new insights into evolution. I am very excited to learn more about the lab, laboratory techniques, and the evolution of stress responses in yeast.

I am originally from Iowa City and I joined Dr. Heâ€™s lab in August 2023. Outside of the lab, I enjoy reading, watching sci fi and fantasy shows, and hiking with friends.
