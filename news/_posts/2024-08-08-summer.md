Our awesome undergraduate students had a great time in the summer! Several of them presented at the Summer Undergraduate Research Conference at the University of Iowa, including [Zoe](https://www.binhe-lab.org/members/zoe-marriner/) and Seren (REU student in the Neiman lab, working with Zoe on the experimental evolution project), [Jess](https://www.binhe-lab.org/members/jessica-miller/), who worked with [Emily](https://www.binhe-lab.org/members/emily-m-obrien) on the divergent response to phosphate limitation across yeasts, and finally [Kelsey](https://www.binhe-lab.org/members/kelsey-martin/), who worked with [Baylee](https://www.binhe-lab.org/members/baylee-bruce) on optimizing the ChIP assay for Pho4 orthologs.
