Excited to announce that we were awarded our first NIH grant, an R35 (Maximizing Investigator's Research Award) titled "Evolution of Stress Response Gene Regulatory Networks in a Commensal and Opportunistic Yeast Pathogen"! To be honest, my feeling is more relief than excitement, because, I can finally focus on my research now! Will be recruiting a postdoc soon.
