Excited to announce that our lab is awarded our first NIH grant, an R35 (Maximizing Investigator's Research Award) titled "Evolution of Stress Response Gene Regulatory Networks in a Commensal and Opportunistic Yeast Pathogen"! More than being excited, I just feel like I can finally focus on my research now! Will be recruiting a postdoc soon.
