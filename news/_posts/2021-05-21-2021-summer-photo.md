After a busy semester is finally over, we decided to have a small get-together at Bread Garden, both to celebrate the end of the semester and the isolation imposed by the pandemic, and also to send off some of our lab members with a mixture of pride and sadness: [Jia](https://www.binhe-lab.org/members/jia-zhao/) has graduated with honor and distinction from the university and will start her graduate school in MIT Biology this fall. Also graduating from the college are [Emily](https://www.binhe-lab.org/members/emily-m-obrien/) and [Diandian](https://www.binhe-lab.org/members/diandian-tang/). Emily will stay in the lab as a research assistant (Yah!) and Diandian will also continue to work in the lab in the summer. In the meantime, our wonderful high school interns, [Ananya](https://www.binhe-lab.org/members/ananya-albrecht-buehler/) and [Peter](https://www.binhe-lab.org/members/shenyuan-chen/), have both graduated from their high schools and will go off to their dream schools this fall -- Oxford in UK for Ananya and UCSD in California for Peter. We will surely miss all of you, best wishes and good luck!
