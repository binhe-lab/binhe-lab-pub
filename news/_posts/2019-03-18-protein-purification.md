Everytime I read a paper or listen to a talk that includes a plethora of gels, and each time I see other people play with the HPLC and columns, I thought I would never do those things -- I'm an evolutionary geneticist after all, or so I believed, until... now we are officially purifying protein from _E. coli_. I know it's trivial for many people, but I'm really proud of what we achieved. Kudos to the heros, Tom Cassier and Kyle Malcolm.
