Our awesome undergraduate researcher [Jessica Miller](https://www.binhe-lab.org/members/jessica-miller/) presents a poster on her work on the polyphosphate quantification in diverse yeast species at the Spring Undergraduate Research Conference. The poster drew a lot of attention, and highlights a new direction we are diving into - how different species decide on nutrient storage and growth strategies. Other members who contributed to this work include Emily O'Brien, Varshu Saravanakumar and Chris Youngstrom.
