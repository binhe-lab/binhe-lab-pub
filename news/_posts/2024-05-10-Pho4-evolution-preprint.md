Our Pho4 evolution paper is on biorxiv! Read it [here](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.04.20.590343v1) or a synopsis in this [twitter thread](https://x.com/BinheLab/status/1783310504242393391). [Lindsey Snyder](https://www.binhe-lab.org/members/lindsey-snyder/) is the leading author, with help from multiple lab members, including [Emily](https://www.binhe-lab.org/members/emily-m-obrien/), [Jia](https://www.binhe-lab.org/members/jia-zhao/), [Jinye](https://www.binhe-lab.org/members/jinye-liang/), [Tom](https://www.binhe-lab.org/members/tom-cassier/), as well as Nick Schnicker at the Protein and Crystallography Facility at the University of Iowa. We also collaborated with Raluca Gordan's lab at Duke, who helped us conduct Protein Binding Microarray experiments (Thanks Yuning and Wei!). Lastly, Xu Zhou started this work when he was a graduate student in the O'Shea lab. How time flies! We are working hard to get this work published in a journal!
