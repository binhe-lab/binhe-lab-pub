Welcome Tom Cassier to join our lab. Tom came to us a solid research background in [Veena Prahlad's lab](https://prahlad.lab.uiowa.edu/) from our department. He will stay with us until the end of May, during which time he will work on recombinant TF purification, BioLayer Interferometry, and will help with a number of lab maintenance tasks. After that, he will go on a solo travel and then, start his medical school at the University of Iowa.
