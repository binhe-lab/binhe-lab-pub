Congratulations to [Jinye](https://www.binhe-lab.org/members/jinye-liang/) and [Lindsey](https://www.binhe-lab.org/members/lindsey-snyder/) for passing their comprehensive exams! This is no small task and as PI, I'm really proud of both of you! If not for the pandemic, we would surely be celebrating with good food and drinks. For now, sweets from [CrÃªpes De Luxe](http://www.crepes-de-luxe.com/) and spicy peanuts from China will take their place :)
