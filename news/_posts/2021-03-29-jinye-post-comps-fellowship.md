Congratulations to [Jinye](https://www.binhe-lab.org/members/jinye-liang/) for being awarded the Graduate College's [Post-Comprehensive Fellowship](https://grad.uiowa.edu/funding/fellowships/post-comp). The competition for this fellowship is especially strong this year, with many more applications than normal. Jinye was nominated by the Integrated Biology Graduate Program housed in the Biology Department and we are proud for her winning the fellowship! (picture credit: snack bought by the awardee herself)
