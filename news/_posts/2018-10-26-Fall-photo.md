This is probably the peak size of the GRE lab, as we luckily have two rotation students joining us in addition to our summer crew. From left to right: Weilong (Jesse) Liu (undergrad assistant), Abhi Godthi (iBio rotation student), Jinye Liang (iBio graduate student), Lindsey Snyder (Genetics rotation student), Jia Zhao (sophomore), Carl Skoog (junior), Bin He, Zoheb Khan (senior), Joe Wisniewski (senior), Kyle Malcolm (senior). Thanks again to our awesome photographer, [Steve Kehoe](https://biology.uiowa.edu/people/steve-kehoe) at the admin office of Biology Department!
