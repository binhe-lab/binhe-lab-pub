Bin helped an undergraduate team address a statistical question in their micropublication. The biological question was whether crayfish recognize themselves in the mirror! It was a lot of fun discussing the phenomenon and working out the stats behind their analysis. Proud to be part of the team. The publication is now online: [publisher's website](https://www.micropublication.org/journals/biology/micropub-biology-001184). The student authors are Stephanie Rocca and Danielle Saldana. Danielle was a student in my Bioinformatics for Beginners course. Their study was part of the Animal Behavior Laboratory taught by [Olga Miakotina](https://biology.uiowa.edu/people/olga-miakotina) and [Dan Eberl](https://biology.uiowa.edu/people/daniel-eberl) in our department.
