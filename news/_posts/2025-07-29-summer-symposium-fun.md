We decided to do a mini-symposium to conclude two months of hard work. We had a number of fantastic undergraduate students joining our regular crew of grad students. They include newly joined UI undergrad Sophia Dallal (profile coming soon) and our REU student [Katelyn Nguyen](https://www.binhe-lab.org/members/katelyn-nguyen), who came to us from UCSD.

We spent a half day talking science, with lively discussions, accompanied by a hearty breakfast and a pizza lunch (MESA, local favorite). We even had some fun playing a Bingo game and gave out two awards to the best graduate and undergraduate talks. Congratulations Baylee and Arib (forgot to take photos).

Lastly, big shout out to [Emily](https://www.binhe-lab.org/members/emily-m-obrien) and [Baylee](https://www.binhe-lab.org/members/baylee-bruce), who did much of the organizing, which include making up a compact yet rich schedule and ordering food.

In addition to science, we also had some fun outside the lab playing sand volleyball. Our captain is a 10+ year veteran of the sport, [Emily](https://www.binhe-lab.org/members/emily-m-obrien). While the team, due to its inexperience, has been smashed by our fearsome opponents, we are having lots of fun nonetheless. See picture!
