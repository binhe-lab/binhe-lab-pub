Our awesome undergraduate member [Kelsey Martin](https://www.binhe-lab.org/members/kelsey-martin) hosts a podcast on spotify called [STEM is Not a Straightforward Path](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4iXlVEOyVRlrC9VLQ9byKg?si=qyL1DLgVSNi4jhugVdPtnA), in which she interviews junior scientists to hear their stories about their path to a scientific career. This is part of her Latham Science Fellow work. Very proud of you, Kelsey. The podcast is really professionally produced and the content is super interesting. Very proud of you, Kelsey.
