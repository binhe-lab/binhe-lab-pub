Before we all go off to each of our family/friends for the holiday break, the lab had some fun playing games and eating delicious food. Emily made her famous pickle roll; Kelsey brought cupcakes; Hubert shared handmade Polish perogies (look and taste just like Chinese jiaozi, or dumpling). Bin made some [pink chai](https://www.teaforturmeric.com/20-minute-kashmiri-chai-pink-tea/). Jess brought egg nog and hot chocolate. Baylee prepared the gingerbread house kits, which we all had fun with! We also played Scientists' trivia (thanks Kelsey!) and [codenames](https://codenames.game/) (thanks Emily and Baylee!). Last but not least, we had two great rotation students this fall: Cole Collins and Rebekah Yarvis, who are also in the pictures. You are all awesome!
