I'm excited to have 6 talented undergrad students and a high school intern to join me for the first summer of research. Gabi Mumm, Joe Wisniewski, Kyle Malcolm, Carl Skoog and Zoheb Khan are from U of Iowa and Ian Wallace is from U of Minnesota. Noah Bullwinkle is from the Iowa City's City High. We are going to form two teams: Team 1 is the TF protein evolution task force, while Team 2 will investigate the target genes of the TF (_C. glabrata_ Pho4). Stay tuned for our first batch of results!
