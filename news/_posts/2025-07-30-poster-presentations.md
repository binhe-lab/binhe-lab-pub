Kudos to our awesome undergraduate students this summer: Arib, Sophia, Angel, Zaw, Katelyn and Frannie. [Arib](https://www.binhe-lab.org/members/arib-mahmud/) and [Katelyn](https://www.binhe-lab.org/members/katelyn-nguyen/) (REU student) presented their work at the Summer Undergraduate Research Conference at the University of Iowa, getting lots of attention and feedback from the audience. Read on to learn about the graduate student poster!

Besides our undergraduate student members, our star graduate duo -- [Emily](https://www.binhe-lab.org/members/emily-m-obrien) and [Jess](https://www.binhe-lab.org/members/jessica-miller/) -- presented their work on the divergent response to phosphate limitation across yeasts at the [Midwest Neglected Infectious Disease Meeting](https://biology.case.edu/2025mnid/) held at the Case Western Researve University in Cleveland, Ohio. [Bin](https://www.binhe-lab.org/members/bin-z-he) also presented the Acquired Stress Resistance work by [Jinye](https://www.binhe-lab.org/jinye-liang) as a plenary talk, getting lots of useful feedback.

So long, summer. Salut, Fall 2025!
