Welcome Lindsey Snyder to join our lab. Lindsey is a first year Interdisciplinary Graduate Programs in Genetics student. During her undergraduate research in the University of Idaho, she has got a solid training in microbiology and molecular biology. She rotated in our lab last fall and we are thrilled to have her officially join the lab. She will work on Pho4 protein evolution, taking advantage of the additional skills in CRISPR and computational biochemistry she gained during her other two rotations. Welcome Lindsey!
