Delayed welcome to [Peter Chen](https://www.binhe-lab.org/members/shenyuan-chen/), who joined us back in January of 2021 as a high school intern. He has been learning and applying Python skills to look at amino acid composition differences between orthologous TFs. Also warm welcome to [Vivek Kumar Srivastava](https://www.binhe-lab.org/members/vivek-kumar-srivastava/), who joined us from his home country of India as a postdoctoral researcher. Vivek has got his Ph.D. in the lab of [Dr. Rupinda Kaur](http://www.cdfd.org.in/labpages/rupinder_Kaur.html), whose work on _C. glabrata_ has been inspiring for me. Vivek will be working on a few projects including the evolution of oxidative stress response between related yeast species with different pathogenic potentials.
