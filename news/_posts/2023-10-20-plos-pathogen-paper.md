Excited to share that our [Acquired stress resistant story](https://www.binhe-lab.org/papers/selected-papers/liang-plos-pathogen/) is now accepted at PLOS Pathogen. We will post a link and a synopsis very soon. This work is started and almostly entirely accomplished by our wonderful graduate student [Jinye Liang](https://www.binhe-lab.org/members/jinye-liang/), with help from other lab members including [Lindsey Snyder](https://www.binhe-lab.org/members/lindsey-snyder/), [Hanxi Tang](https://www.binhe-lab.org/members/hanxi-tang/) and [Chris Youngstrom](https://www.binhe-lab.org/members/chris-youngstrom/). Congratulations to the team!

We had a small gathering to celebrate the acceptance of the paper, at the Backpocket Brewery in Coralville. In the photo: (left, from the far side) Jinye, Lindsey, Yann; (right, from far side) Chris, Mellisa; Bin was taking the picture.
