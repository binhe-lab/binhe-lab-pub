Warm welcome to the newest members of the lab: Abhishiktha Godthi is a first year iBio graduate student and Diandian Tang is a junior UI undergrad. Check out their profiles in the Team/Join page. We are sad to say goodbye to Joe Wisniewski, who has been one of the earliest members of the lab and has helped the lab in many ways, including being the safety and MSDS tzar and working on the Pho4 target validation project. Good luck Joe, you will be an awesome doctor!
