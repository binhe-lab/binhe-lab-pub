Congratulations to our former MS student [Hanxi Tang](https://www.binhe-lab.org/members/hanxi-tang/), who led the work optimizing a LIVE/DEAD assay for quantifying yeast post-stress survival in a fast and scalable fashion. This is a companion paper to the main work from Hanxi's thesis (see [previous post](https://www.binhe-lab.org/news/fungalight-method-preprint/)). We are grateful that [Jess](https://www.binhe-lab.org/members/jessica-miller/) agreed to join the team and help with experiments after Hanxi graduated, including doing the video demonstration that is the trademark of the Journal of Visual Experiments! Read it [here](https://app.jove.com/t/69005/an-optimized-livedead-assay-coupled-with-flow-cytometry-for) or download it from this [site](https://www.binhe-lab.org/papers/Tang-JoVE-2025/). Congrartulations again to all authors, especially Hanxi, who is now a PhD student in the Chemical and Systems Biology program at Stanford University.
