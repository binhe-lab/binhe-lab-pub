The GRE lab had a good summer, with several new undergraduate students joining us, including [Sarai](https://www.binhe-lab.org/members/sarai-badillo/), who came to us from U of Texas at Permian Basin and is here for the Interdisciplinary Evolutionary Biology REU program. Also here is [Sierra](https://www.binhe-lab.org/members/sierra-frisvold/), who is a high school senior and with us as an intern. We also had a nice ice-cream social, where we welcomed our new rotation graduate students, Lucretia and Chase.
