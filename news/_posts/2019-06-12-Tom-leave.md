Tom started as a senior RA in our lab after plenty of research experience from the Prahlad lab. We were lucky to have him and he has helped jump start the BioLayer Interferometry experiments. Now he is on to his dream trip -- a solo drive through Canada to Alaska -- before he starts his medical school here at UIowa. Good luck, Tom! We always welcome you come back to visit!
