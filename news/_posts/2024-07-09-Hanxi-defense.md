Congratulations to [Hanxi](https://www.binhe-lab.org/members/hanxi-tang/), who successfully defended her MS thesis titled "Divergence of Acquired Stress Resistance Among Yeast Species and Establishing a Flow Cytometry-based Assay for Post-Stress Survival Quantification".

A stellar undergraduate student from our own Department of Biology, Hanxi carried on her excellence in academics during her MS training and managed to complete an impressive amount of work during her 2 short years in the lab. Her main project involves establishing a dye-based viability assay that we are now working on publishing. After graduation, she is going to join the Chemical and Systems Biology graduate program at Stanford University, where she is sure to excel in her studies and break multiple new grounds. Best of luck Hanxi. Keep us in mind when you continue your academic journey!
