First Ph.D. minted from the GRE lab! [Lindsey Snyder](https://www.binhe-lab.org/members/Lindsey-Snyder/) successfully defended her thesis on "Evolution of stress response regulators and adhesin genes in pathogenic yeast". Lindsey has had a productive Ph.D. training, with one co-first and one co-second author publications, and a first-author publication being submitted right now. Her broad skillsets, including biochemistry, genetics and flow cytometry, her ability to work with others and her devotion to mentoring new members make her invaluable to the lab. We will all miss her after she leaves!
