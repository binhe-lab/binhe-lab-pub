We gathered at the Texas Roadhouse for a nice dinner. It was both to celebrate the end of the semester, and, with bitter-sweetness, see off several members, who are leaving the lab for their next steps. Our first minted Ph.D., [Lindsey Snyder](https://www.binhe-lab.org/members/lindsey-snyder), will be moving to Cambridge, MA and hopefully will be joining an exciting biotech venture soon! [Cole](https://www.binhe-lab.org/members/cole-belcher) is going to graduate and join the [Pathogbiology graduate program](https://vetmed.illinois.edu/about-the-college/pathobiology/grad-programs/) at UIUC as a MS student this fall. [Anthony](https://www.binhe-lab.org/members/anthony-pannullo) is going to start as a postdoctoral researcher in the USDA National Center for Agricultural Utilization Research in Illinois, with a career path to become a group leader at the institution. Lastly, Jinye and Hanxi are going to defense this summer. Hanxi will be joining the [Chemical and Systems Biology graduate program](https://chemsysbio.stanford.edu/ph-d-program/) at Stanford, and will be away during the summer. So, this is also a fareware party for them. Good luck all the GRE'ers! Proud of all of you and keep in touch!
