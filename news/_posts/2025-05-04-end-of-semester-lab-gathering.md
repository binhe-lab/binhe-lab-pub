It's the end of the school year. Three of our wonderful undergraduate students are graduating this year. Enough reason for a gathering! We had a lot of fun eating brunch, playing volleyball and football (soccer).

Also, [Kelsey](https://www.binhe-lab.org/members/kelsey-martin/) presented her honors thesis work and before that, was awarded the [Clifford W. Hesseltine Award for Academic Excellence](https://biology.uiowa.edu/undergraduate/scholarships) from the Biology Department. Congratulations on both! This is the second undergraduate student from our lab who won this award (last one was [Jia Zhao](https://www.binhe-lab.org/members/jia-zhao/). Very proud of our lab members!
