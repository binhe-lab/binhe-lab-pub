As a response to the pandemic-forced lab shut-down, we organized a programming bootcamp over the summer, where half the lab followed the CodeHS's [Python course](https://codehs.com/course/python3/overview), and the other half followed Udacity's [Data Analysis with R course](https://www.udacity.com/course/data-analysis-with-r--ud651) (thanks to the recommendation by [Pleuni Pennings](https://abetterscientist.wordpress.com/2020/05/07/how-we-run-an-inclusive-online-coding-program-for-biology-and-chem-undergrads-in-2020/)). We also had a new member -- Ananya, who joined us as a high school intern and has been amazing! After finishing the courses, I assigned real research problems to both groups. In the past two weeks, both teams reported their results at the lab meeting. Moreove, to make our research accessible and reproducible, both teams' results are on github. [Team 1 (Erin, Jia)](https://github.com/binhe-lab/Summer-2020-Nucleosome-Occupancy); [Team 2 (Amanda, Ananya)](https://github.com/ananyaab/CGlabrata). Proud of our students!
