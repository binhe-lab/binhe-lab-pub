Our awesome member (terrific undergraduate student mentor), Dr. Chris Youngstrom, is going to move to his next position as a scientist and postdoctoral researcher in his Ph.D. field - plants! He won't be moving very far (Ames, IA). We wish him all the best. Hope to see you when you visit back at Iowa City!
