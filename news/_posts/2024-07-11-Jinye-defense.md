Congratulations to [Jinye](https://www.binhe-lab.org/members/jinye-liang/), who successfully defended her PhD thesis titled "Evolution of Acquired Stress Resistance in an Opportunistic Yeast Pathogen"

Jinye is the very first graduate student in the lab. More importantly, she is among the most independent students and most careful experimentalists. Her publication, which didn't come early nor in large numbers, is almost all attributed to her alone. She started the project by proving her PI wrong, and plowed ahead into unchartered territories, breaking new grounds as she marched. Incredible! She is now moving to LA to join her significant other, and is interviewing for both academic and industry jobs. Keep us posted and very best luck to your next adventure!
