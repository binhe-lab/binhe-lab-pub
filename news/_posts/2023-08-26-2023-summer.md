It has been a very busy and productive summer for the GRE lab. First, it was [Cole](https://www.binhe-lab.org/members/cole-belcher/) and [Ava](https://www.binhe-lab.org/members/ava-gabrys/)'s poster presentations at the Summer Undergraduate Research Conference (SURF). Before the end of the REU program, the lab also organized a potlock (we miss you, Ava!). [Lindsey](https://www.binhe-lab.org/members/lindsey-snyder), [Emily](https://www.binhe-lab.org/members/emily-m-obrien) and [Baylee](https://www.binhe-lab.org/members/baylee-bruce) went to the Summer Symposium at the Penn State University, on the topic of "Chromatin and Regulation of Gene Expression". All three presented their work and got a lot of feedback. Last but not least, Cole, [Varshu](https://www.binhe-lab.org/members/varshu-saravanakumar/), [Hanxi](https://www.binhe-lab.org/members/hanxi-tang) and myself went to UIUC to join the Midwest Neglected Infectious Disease conference, where we made lots of friends! Summer is too short, as always...
