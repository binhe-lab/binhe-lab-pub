Bin was invited to give a talk on our recent [adhesin paper](https://www.binhe-lab.org/papers/selected-papers/smoak-biorxiv-2022/) at the SMBE satellite meeting on the [Evolution of Fungal Pathogens](https://event.fourwaves.com/smbe-meeting-evolution-of-fungal-pathogens/pages). The talk went well and attracted many interests. The conference was held in the [old Quebec City](https://photos.app.goo.gl/Qtfx3YhkG6QdTmVUA), which is a great place to visit!
