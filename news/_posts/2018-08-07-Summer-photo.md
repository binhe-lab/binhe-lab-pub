These are the awesome students who were brave enough to join a new PI's lab. From left to right: Ian Wallace(rising sophomore from U of Minn), Jinye Liang (1st year iBio graduate student), Kyle Malcolm (rising senior of UI), Jia Zhao (rising sophomore of UI), Bin He (yup, that dude), Carl Skoog (rising junior of UI), Zoheb Khan (rising senior of UI). Joe Wisniewski, who is also a rising senior of UI, couldn't join us because he is back home in Illinois. Lastly, big thanks to our awesome photographer, [Steve Kehoe](https://biology.uiowa.edu/people/steve-kehoe) at the admin office of Biology Department!
