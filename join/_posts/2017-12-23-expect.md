### What to expect from me

- Discuss with you to reach a mutual understanding of your career goals, and create opportunities for you to reach there.
- Meet with you at least weekly to discuss your work and exchange ideas.
- Teach you _how to gain_ experimental and bioinformatics skills.
- Help you interpret experimental results, decide on next steps and prioritize them.
- Help you prepare proposals/manuscripts, including editing drafts and providing feedbacks on your written work.
- Go over your career development plans once a year to see if you are on track for your goals.
- Support your application for fellowships/graduate school/jobs.
- Support you to attend one research conference a year, local or national.

### What I expect of you

- Conduct yourself with the utmost scientific integrity. Never manipulate data or plagiarize written work (including your own previous work).
- Understand that science is a troubleshooting process, and success only comes after many failures.
- Maintain a clear research notebook documenting enough information so others (and yourself) can reproduce the results.
- Keep detailed notes on computational work (e.g. [workflowr](https://github.com/jdblischak/workflowr)); document all custom scripts (e.g. [r_notebook](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/r_notebooks.html)); version control code and results (e.g. [git](https://www.git-scm.com)).
- Treat all your lab mates with respect, regardless of their career stage. Each person is an important contributor to our team and has unique merits that we can learn from.
