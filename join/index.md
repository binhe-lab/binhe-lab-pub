As a junior PI, I plan to grow my lab slowly and will work closely with members of the lab. I'm looking for both graduate students (MS and PhD) and research technicians who are curious, responsible and motivated. In addition to those qualities, I expect scientific integrity and honesty. In return, you can expect Prior experience with microbiology genetics, R programming and genomics experiments are desirable but not required. As long as you are interested in what we are doing, and serious about doing reproducible science, you are in!
