<p>We are looking for graduate students, research technicians and postdoctoral fellows to join our lab. We are seeking candidates with backgrounds in molecular biology, physical sciences or engineering. Research projects in our lab will combine genomic and biochemical experimental approaches with computational modeling. We use mammalian and microbial cells as experimental models.
</p>
<p> Technician and postdoc candidates should email their CV, a 1 page statement of research interests, and contact information for three references. Graduate students at the University of Washington can arrange an in-person meeting to discuss possible rotation projects. </p>
