    <h2>Evolution of Stress Response</h2>
    <p>Stress response is essential for survival. As species evolve and occupy novel ecological niches, they may encounter new patterns of stresses, for which their ancestral stress response network may be no longer optimal. How do stress response networks evolve in the face of novel challenges? Our lab studies the evolution of stress response regulation between commensal yeast and their free-living relatives. Our goal is twofold: 1) to reveal general rules about gene regulatory network (GRN) evolution and 2) to identify how microbes adapt to the host environment, which may inform treatment and disease prevention.</p><a class="btn btn-warning btn-lg" href="/research/" role="button">Learn more</a>
